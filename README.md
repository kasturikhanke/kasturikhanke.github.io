## Welcome to my github page! 
### I am a Second Year Master's student in the HCDE program. I have a background in Industrial Design. 
I am interested in digital fabrication because I want to explore and learn the differnt tools that can be used to create new and fun things. 
I have done some laser cutting and silcone molding before and I would love to help my peers out with it.

For my final project, I created a jewelry box with a ring.

### Bill of materials

I want to use plywood for making my box. 
I will be purchasing this from Amazon- https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DKCVTB2 
$15.85 

Rest of the materials, I already own- Oomo mixture, 3D filament and hardstone. 

### Stretch Goals
I was not able to do them. 

### Technical Documentation 

For the ring mold, I first pulled up a ring from thingiverse. Added a box mold around the stl ring. 
I used the molding box from the previous assignment and just followed the same steps. 

For the box, I used finger joints as the joinery method to connect the different pieces. 

### Source Files 

I got the ring stl from thingiverse. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:711970

# HCDE 533 Final Project 

# Concept 

For my final project, I created a jewelry box with a ring.

# Steps 

I started the project with this sketch.

In class, I got feedback to try to add compartments to the box in order to sort my jewely better. So I added that. Other students got feedback to make a ring instead of earrings and so I did that as well. 



## The Box

After laser cutting the box, I found that the finger joints were too tight. I had to hammer them in. But this was good since it made the box seal better.

I then tried out different raster sizes on the plywood by experimenting with the speed and power to find the thickness for the right slot. I had to use a rasp to sand out the edges of the inner box so it would fit better. This also helped in getting rid of the soot.

## The Ring

For the ring, I found a ring on thigiverse and created a mold for it.

After 3D printing the mold, I added Oomo to it.

After casting, this is how the ring turned out

### Special thanks to Professor Nadya and TA Junchao for making this class fun while teching how to fabricate! 

### Techniques used
- Laser cutting
- Rhino
- 3D printing 
- Mold design 


### Bill of materials

The plywood costed $15.85 
 (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DKCVTB2) 


Rest of the materials, I already own- Oomo mixture, 3D filament and hardstone. 


### Technical Documentation 

For the ring mold, I first pulled up a ring from thingiverse. Added a box mold around the stl ring. 
I used the molding box from the previous assignment and just followed the same steps. 

For the box, I used finger joints as the joinery method to connect the different pieces. 

### Source Files 

I got the ring stl from thingiverse. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:711970

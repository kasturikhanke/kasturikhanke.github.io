# Final Project Proposal! 


For my final project, I want to create a little jewelry box and mold an earring using silicone and hardwood stone. 

My house can be a little unorgaznied. This is me every time I walk inside my apartment...

I want to organize my mess a little more and what better way than to do it through an assignment?!

### The tasks involved will be:

- Create a box with a drawer in Rhino
- Making a model in Rhino for the earrings 
- 3D printing the mold for pouring silicone
- Curing the hardstone for the jewelry

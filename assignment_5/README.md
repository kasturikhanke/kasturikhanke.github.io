PART 1: 

I got a mesh part from this link: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:570288 

I combined that with a cylinder at the bottom to see how it would work.

The mesh is good to print.

Upon uploading it to the Slicer, it was able to slice it. Printing time is 4h.

PART 2:

Initially, I wanted to try out complex models in rhino. So I played around with grasshopper.

But printing these lamps seemed to be complicated and a lot of waste. I then set a time constraint for myself and a challenge to find a minimal innerd for the lamp where I could use materials I already had at home. 

I think ideated on how I would want the lamp to look.

For the innerd, I created a circular shape.

The 3D printer took around 45 mins to print the circular innerd.

Shoutout:
Thanks to David Pearl for helping me out figure out what kind of a lamp I wanted to make. He helped me ideate on a more sustainable lamp.
